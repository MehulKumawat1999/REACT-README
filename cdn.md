## What is a CDN?
  A content delivery network (CDN) is a network of interconnected servers that speeds up webpage loading for data-heavy applications. CDN can stand for content delivery network or content     distribution network. When a user visits a website, data from that website's server has to travel across the internet to reach the user's computer. If the user is located far from that server, it will take a long time to load a large file, such as a video or website image. Instead, the website content is stored on CDN servers geographically closer to the users and reaches their computers much faster.

## Why is a CDN important?
  > The primary purpose of a content delivery network (CDN) is to reduce latency, or reduce 
  > the delay in communication created by a network's design. Because of the global and complex nature of   the 
  > internet, communication traffic between websites (servers) and their users (clients) has to move over large 
  > physical distances. The communication is also two-way, with requests going      from the client to the server 
  > and responses coming back.

  > A CDN improves efficiency by introducing intermediary servers between the client and the website server. These 
  > CDN servers manage some of the client-server communications. They decrease web   traffic to the web server, 
  > reduce bandwidth consumption, and improve the user experience of your applications.

## What are the benefits of CDNs?
  Content delivery networks (CDNs) provide many benefits that improve website performance and support core network infrastructure. For example, a CDN can do the following tasks:

  - Reduce page load time
    Website traffic can decrease if your page load times are too slow. A CDN can reduce bounce rates and increase the time users spend on your site.

  - Reduce bandwidth costs
    Bandwidth costs are a significant expense because every incoming website request consumes network bandwidth. Through caching and other optimizations, CDNs can reduce the amount of data an     origin server must provide, reducing the costs of hosting for website owners.

  - Increase content availability
    Too many visitors at one time or network hardware failures can cause a website to crash. CDN services can handle more web traffic and reduce the load on web servers. Also, if one or more      CDN servers go offline, other operational servers can replace them to ensure uninterrupted service.

  - Improve website security
    Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks attempt to take down applications by sending large amounts of fake traffic to the website. CDNs can handle such traffic spikes by distributing     the load between several intermediary servers, reducing the impact on the origin server.
